      <p>Organic farming can be defined as an agricultural process that uses biological fertilisers and pest control acquired from animal or plant waste. Organic farming was actually initiated as an answer to the environmental sufferings caused by the use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilisers. In other words, organic farming is a new system of farming or agriculture that repairs, maintains, and improves the ecological balance.
        <h2>Types of Organic Farming</h2>
        Organic farming is divided into two types, namely:<br>
                        1.Integrated organic farming<br>
                        2.Pure organic farming
        <h2>Organic farming has many benefits, including:</h2>
        <h3>Soil health:</h3> Organic farming protects soil health by avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which can promote biodiversity and preserve microorganisms that are essential for nutrient-rich crops. Organic farming practices like crop rotation, composting, and using organic matter can also help foster long-term fertility and sustainability.
        <h3>Water quality: </h3>Organic farming can help prevent water pollution and preserve water quality by avoiding synthetic chemicals.
        <h3>Climate change mitigation: </h3>Organic farming can help mitigate the greenhouse effect and global warming by sequestering carbon in the soil.
        <h3>Biodiversity conservation: </h3>Organic farming can help conserve biodiversity.
        <h3>Healthier food:</h3> Organic farming can potentially produce healthier food options.
        <h3>Support for local communities:</h3> Organic farming often involves smaller-scale, local operations, which can provide economic benefits to rural communities.
        <h3>Environment-friendly:</h3> Organic farming is an environment-friendly way of farming that protects water, air, and soil from chemical pollution.
        <h3>Sustainable development: </h3>Organic farming promotes sustainable development.
