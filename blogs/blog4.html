      <p><h1>What is IPM?</h1>
        Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an effective and environmentally sensitive approach to pest management that relies on a combination of common-sense practices. IPM programs use current, comprehensive information on the life cycles of pests and their interaction with the environment. This information, in combination with available pest control methods, is used to manage pest damage by the most economical means, and with the least possible hazard to people, property, and the environment.<br>
        The IPM approach can be applied to both agricultural and non-agricultural settings, such as the home, garden, and workplace. IPM takes advantage of all appropriate pest management options including, but not limited to, the judicious use of pesticides. In contrast, organic food production applies many of the same concepts as IPM but limits the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals.
        <h3>The role of IPM in sustainable agriculture:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Applies sustainable pest control:</h3>IPM builds on ecosystem services such as pest predation while protecting others, such as pollination. It also contributes to increased farm productivity and food availability by reducing pre- and post-harvest crop losses.</li>
            <li><h3>Reduces pesticide residues: </h3>IPM contributes to food and water safety, as reducing the amount of pesticides used in turn reduces residues in food, feed and fiber, and environment.</li>
            <li><h3>Enhances ecosystem services: </h3>IPM seeks to maintain the national crop ecosystem balance. It conserves the underlying natural resource base (i.e. soil, water and biodiversity) and enhances ecosystem services (i.e. pollination, healthy soils, diversity of species).</li>
            <li><h3>Increases income levels: </h3>IPM reduces production costs through reduced levels of pesticide use. Higher quality crops (with less residues) can command better prices in markets and contribute to increased farmer profitability. </li>
            <li><h3>Strengthens farmer knowledge:</h3> IPM promotes farmer stewardship, increases farmer knowledge of ecosystem functioning adapted to their local context.  </li>
        </ul>
