      <p>Soil health management is the practice of maintaining or improving soil's physical, chemical, and biological properties to support plant growth and environmental resources. Healthy soil is fertile and has beneficial properties that regulate water, air, and nutrients, and support nutrient cycling and biological pest control.<br>
        Pathogens, parasites, and root feeders are disease-causing organisms in soil that can affect plant productivity. Part of good soil health practices involves minimizing these disease-causing soil organisms while also maximizing beneficial soil organisms.<br>
        Healthy soil is the foundation of productive, sustainable agriculture.
        Managing for soil health allows producers to work with the land – not against – to reduce erosion, maximize water infiltration, improve nutrient cycling, save money on inputs, and ultimately improve the resiliency of their working land.
        <h2>Here are some practices that can help improve soil health:</h2>
        <h3>Minimize disturbance</h3>
        Avoid physical, chemical, or biological activities that can disrupt soil microbes, such as tillage.
        <h3>Cover the soil</h3>
        Keep the ground covered as much as possible with living plants, cover crops, organic mulch, or plant residue.
        <h3>Increase plant diversity</h3>
        Grow a variety of plant species and use diverse crop rotations to break disease cycles and provide habitats for pollinators and other organisms.
        <h3>Add organic materials</h3>
        Use a variety of organic materials from cover crops, crop residues, animal manures, and composts to improve soil's physical, chemical, and biological properties.
